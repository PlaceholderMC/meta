# PlaceholderMC Meta
Scripts to generate jsons and jars that PlaceholderMC will access.

## Deployment
It is recommended to use Docker to deploy the environment.

- Clone this repo to a server
- Make sure it's writable by the container later: `chown -R 1337:1337 .`
- Configure `config/config_local.sh`
  - The defaults should be fine (apart from committer email and name perhaps)
- Put your SSH key (which has push access to meta-upstream and meta-polymc) at `config/deploy.key`
- Pull meta- repos: `bash clone.sh`
- Customize docker-compose.yaml
- Run `docker-compose up -d --build`
- Observe Cron logs using `docker-compose logs -f` (Runs hourly by default)
- (Optional) Run once to fill caches: `docker-compose run meta update`

For local development you can also use `docker-compose.local.yaml`. By default it uses `UID=1000` and `GID=1000`.
Make sure it's the same as your host instance.
